# Definition
On-demand delivery of IT resources over the internet with pay as you go pricing.
>[!info]+
>**On-demand delivery**:  Access to computing resources such as storage or compute power, within seconds and as needed. Usage can be scaled up/down on current requirements.
>**IT resources**: Includes servers, storage, databases, networking components, AI/ML tools. They can be used to build, deploy and manage applications and services.
> **Over the internet**: Delivers IT resources remotely through internet connection, which means no need to maintain local hardware/software.
> **Pay-as-you-go pricing**: Pay only for what is consumed as opposed to being locked into fixed, long term contract. Offers cost efficiency and financial flexibility.

# Advantages
+ Both large and small companies can access the latest technology without paying high costs to own it.
+ Companies are free to focus on the product and leave the computing administration to the provider such as advanced security measures and backups.
+ Updates and maintenance can be distributed company-wide in a single click.
+ Breaks dependency on the office, allowing developers to work from home or another location with a internet connection.
# Disadvantages
+ Loss of control over data that may be sensitive. Requires trust that the cloud provider will protect data with the same care you would in house.
+ Less control over maintenance since it is handled by the cloud provider, may not be available 24/7 in case issue occurs.
+ Data centers of cloud providers are more appealing targets for hackers due to the sheer amount and variety of data that they contain.
# Alternatives
1. On-premises Deployment
2. Hybrid: Mix of cloud and on-premise

## Infrastructure as a service (IAAS)
+ Least dependent on cloud provider.
+ Use IAAS to request and configure IT resources required to run your application.
+ User is responsible for deploying and maintaining application, as well as backups and security. 
+ Cloud provider only provides the physical infrastructure.
+ Ex: Amazon EC2, S3, Google Compute Engine, Windows Azure
## Platform as a service(PAAS)
+ Provider handles backend infrastructure.
+ Developers use provided tools and services - programming languages, middleware, databases, testing and deployment environments to build their applications.
+ Ex: AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Heroku, Google App Engine
## Software as a service (SAAS)
+ Instead of purchasing and installing software, can access through web browser or app, with the software and infrastructure hosted and managed by a third party provider.
+ Ex: Dropbox, Microsoft Office 365, Gmail
