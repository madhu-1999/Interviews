# What is NAS?
![NAS  architecture](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200605132810/1406-6.png)
+ NAS Server is a dedicated storage server that handles data and file requests only.
+ Client devices and NAS are on a LAN and all devices on the network can access NAS server.
+ Contains unstructured data such as video, audio, files, websites etc..
+ File-level access using protocols like NFS, SMB
# Uses
+ Storing and exchanging files
+ For data archival and backups
+ Stream torrents and media files
# Components
- ***Processor:*** Every NAS has a processor at its core, which monitor the memory and central processing unit (CPU).
- ***Interface of a network:*** USB and Wi-Fi connectivity are two examples of direct computer connections that small Network Storage Devices (NAS) intended for desktop or single-user use may support.
- ***Physical storage:*** It usually takes the form of disc drives, is a requirement for every NAS. The drives, which frequently accommodate a variety of various storage devices, may be conventional magnetic HDDs, SSDs, or other non-volatile memory devices.
- ***Operating System:*** The OS arranges and controls the NAS hardware and makes storage accessible to clients, such as users and other apps, much like it does on a traditional computer.
# Advantages
+ Centralized storage
+ Ease of access
+ Scalable - can scale up (add more storage devices on same NAS server) or scale out (multiple NAS servers communicate via an API or protocol)
+ Data redundancy and backup through [[RAID]]
+ Admin can define which users can access what files and edit permissions.
# Disadvantages
+ Management complexity
+ Difficult to scale quickly i.e. on-demand
+ No storage service guarantees
