+ Inheritance allows a class to **inherit fields and methods** of another class called **parent class**.
+ The **class that inherits** is called **child class**.
+ Child class can add its own fields and methods in addition to parent class fields and methods.
+ Supports **reusability** of code.
+ **Difficult to change superclass** without changing subclass, due to **tight coupling**.

## Types of inheritance
