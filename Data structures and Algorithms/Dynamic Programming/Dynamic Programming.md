# Properties
## Overlapping Subproblem
+ Problem can be broken down into subproblems such that same subproblem(s) appear repeatedly.![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20220815013010/fibonaci.jpg)
## Optimal Substructure
A given problem is said to have ****Optimal Substructure Property**** if the optimal solution of the given problem can be obtained by using the optimal solution to its subproblems instead of trying every possible way to solve the subproblems.
